## The Mission: From Buzzwords to Blueprints

The multi-cloud paradigm promised flexibility but often delivered operational chaos and a new, insidious form of vendor lock-in. Most "multi-cloud" strategies fail to deliver true portability, resulting in higher operational complexity and a disguised form of vendor lock-in.

The **Open Omni-Cloud** initiative was created to fix this. Our mission is to build an ecosystem where cloud systems can be verified, tested, and trusted across providers. We believe in **Contracts Over Abstractions**: a verifiable, testable contract is what defines a standard, not lowest-common-denominator abstractions. We are building the open standard for the next generation of cloud architecture.

## What We Build: The Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK)

A contract is only as good as its enforcement. The core of our work is the **Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK)**, a `pytest`-based test suite that validates and certifies that a provider implementation adheres to the strict behavioral contracts of the Open Omni-Cloud standard.

A provider that successfully passes the TCK is guaranteed to be a **certified drop-in replacement**, enabling true portability and resilience by design.

## The Six Pillars of a Truly Omni-Cloud Architecture

Our standard is built upon six specific, verifiable criteria:

1.  **Agnostic Providers:** Interact with external dependencies through unified interfaces with consistent semantics.
2.  **A Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK):** A suite of automated tests that validates any provider implementation against the defined contract.
3.  **Swap by Configuration:** Switching between compliant providers must require only configuration changes, with zero refactoring of business code.
4.  **Cross-Cloud Failover Targets:** Demonstrated failover capabilities with pre-defined, aggressive, and tested recovery targets.
5.  **Standardized Observability:** First-class OpenTelemetry (traces, metrics, logs) and "Golden Signals" dashboards by default.
6.  **Portable Policies & Compliance:** Policies for data residency, encryption, and auditing must live inside the abstraction layer and travel with the workload.

## Our Projects

Our primary focus is the development and maintenance of the TCKs that enforce the standard.

-   **[tck-py](https://github.com/open-omni-cloud/tck-py)**: The official Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK) for Python implementations of the Open Omni-Cloud standard. It provides an executable contract for everything from primitives and messaging to resilience and observability patterns.

## ü§ù How to Get Involved

This is a community-driven initiative, and we invite engineers, providers, and organizations to join us in shaping a truly Omni-Cloud future.

| **Contribute Code** | **Sponsor the Initiative** | **Join the Discussion** |
